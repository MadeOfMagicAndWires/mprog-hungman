#Hungman

It's like hangman, only gramatically incorrect.

In this version of hangman, instead of having to guess a single word by naming letters, the answer can be *all* the words containing any of the letters you've guessed. Or not depending on which is harder.

Basically, you're being scammed, I hope you didn't bet any money on this.
